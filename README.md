# Course Registration Website Welcome to the Course Registration Website! This website allows user to select courses, Add them to their cart and manage those course which they have selected.Here are the key feature-ðŸš€ 
* Add course to the Cart ðŸ›’
Here, a user can browse through multiple courses and add them to their cart section by clicking the 'select' button.
* Restriction on adding duplicate courses ðŸš«
A user may unintentionally add one course multiple times. However, here, it is not possible. I have prevented the user from selecting one course multiple times.
* Credit hour limit of 20 hours â�³
A credit hour limit of 20 hours is enforced in the cart. This prevents the user from exceeding the limit.
* Total credit counter ðŸ”¢ Lastly, it may be overwhelming for a user to count the credit hours again and again after selecting courses. No need to worry! A real-time counter has been added to the cart, and it changes dynamically if a user selects any course.
